# Smoking Cigarettes

I used to smoke when I went out with friends.  That was years ago. I left that behind me as one of those things I did in college.

## Tonight

I went out with someone I met recently at a cafe.  A friend of a friend.  We had an okay time, but I did not feel the chemistry I had hoped for.  We went to a restaurant that was okay.. I do not think we have the same palette. Later we met up with some of her friends for drinks and cigarettes. I felt out of place. Like an old man spending time with kids.  I know I am not really that old, but I felt as if I was acting up...

## Anxiety

I felt anxious.  Not necessarily like uncomfortable in my skin... but the kind of anxious where I was question my actions.  Like why was I taking someone out? Like what are my intentions? What is the point? 

## Fun?

I do not know if this I really had a good time.  Can I not just do things for fun? Maybe, but really what is the point? I could have spent my time cleaning my home.. or exercising.. or just doing things that really bring me joy. Instead, I did this little posturing dance.. that felt disingenuous.

## Cigarettes

And here I am smoking a cigarette in a parking lot listening to Johnny Cash... completely alone and somewhat depressed making a fool of myself.  

This is behavior I thought I was over.. I think I am over... but I do on these rare occasions want to prove that I still am a man. or maybe that I still am that man.  The man of my youth.  

## The Bar Scene

The crowd at this bar tonight was very attracive, but also very odd. I felt like we were doing this little tango... We were all sizing up one another. I mean this is a bar so we are looking for partners, but what kind of partner can I expect to meet at a bar?

## Treating my Body with Disrespect

I had a drink and maybe a half.. They were okay.. but I know these are not good for my body. I also had two cigarettes. I admit that I really liked those.. but I know.. God I know what they do to the body. 

## Rationalizing Bad Behavior

I tell myslef... oh it is just one cigarette. It is just one drink... and maybe that is kind of true.. but just practicing that type of behavior imprints upon the body that is okay to drink.. to smoke.. to do these ridiculous things. 

## Do it again? 

Nah.. simply nah. That scene is not for me. I am ready to move on. I experienced it again.. for the first time in 5 years. I had enough. I would rather go for a run.
